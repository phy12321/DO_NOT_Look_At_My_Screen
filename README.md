### How It Works

The code is based on a light Face detection algorithm, and it works quite **simple**: Counting the number of faces in real time, if number is not 1, the screen brightness will be reduced.

**Test Platform:** Lenovo xiaoxin pro13, **i7 10710U + MX250**, 16G(2666MHz) + 512G SSD

CPU occupancy is in 20--40%, GPU 0%.  

The fan of laptop is still at 18 ℃, which means **it is lightweight and won't occupy too much computing resources.**
